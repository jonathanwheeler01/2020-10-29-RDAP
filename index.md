## Research Data Access & Preservation Workshop: Collaborative Curation of Open Educational Datasets

The RDAP Education & Resources committee presents the second in a series of online, interactive workshops: Collaboratively Curating Open, Educational Datasets. Participants in this event will have an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with common data curation strategies and tools by curating a publicly available dataset to improve its FAIR-ness and educational fitness-for-purpose.

## Objectives

The purpose of this workshop is to offer librarians interested in data curation to work with experienced data curators in a hands-on professional development and networking opportunity. Broadly, through this and similar workshops we will:

* Encourage the use of authentic data for educational purposes, including data curation best practices and the application of domain specific methods where appropriate.
* Identify and publish a detailed process for creating a semi-clean dataset through collaboration with team members who have data curation or disciplinary expertise. The curated datasets will be contextualized by creating one or more sample lessons with learning objectives that can be supported with the available dataset. Open platforms and technologies will be used to the extent possible.
* Use community developed resources for data curation, education, and public access in order to encourage their adoption in other contexts.
